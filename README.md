#### Review of Luigi's Mansion and aspects that need testing

## Review

Luigi's Mansion is an action adventure game that encourages the player to explore the mansion in order to progress. It was directed by Hideki Konno of Nintendo. The Player takes control of Luigi as he explores a haunted mansion in search of his missing brother, Mario. The Player is given a flashlight, a vacuum cleaner, and a Game Boy Horror to progress through the game. The flashlight can be used to stun ghosts, which are the game's enemies. The player can then suck up the stunned ghost with the vacuum cleaner which is called The Poltergust 3000. The Game Boy Horror shows the Player how much treasure they have collected, a map of the mansion, and information on captured ghosts. It also has a radar function to help the Player find Boos, which are type of ghost the player must capture in order to beat the game.

## What Needs Testing

While I did not find very many problems with the game, there are a few things that I believe should be tested to ensure quality. They are the range of the flashlight, the radar, and the mirrors in the game.

There was no set range of the flashlight stated, so I did run into some problems trying to catch ghosts from a safe distance. I eventually decided on waiting for the ghost to come extremely close before using my flashlight to stun them. I believe that the flashlight's range should be playtested some more. If any other people feel that the range is too short, then the range should be increased.

Another problem I had was with the Boo Radar used to find Boos in the game. The Radar has a short range limited to the room you are in. This makes chasing escaped Boos a challenge. It also makes the task of finding all the Boos, something required to beat the game, a tedious one. The radar changes color the closer you are to a Boo and the radar has 3 levels. I think it would be better if there was a fourth level to the radar. One that tells the player they are in the same Floor as a Boo, one that says they are in the same room as a Boo, and one that says they are right next to a Boo hiding spot, along with the base level (not being anywhere close to a Boo). Although both of these options should be tested to make sure having four levels for the radar does not make the game too easy or even having the reverse effect of making the game too tedious for players.

In the game, you can enter first person mode with the Game Boy Horror by pressing the "X" button. While in this mode, you can get information on surrounding items and some of the stronger ghost by pressing the "A" button while looking at the object you want information on. However, if you look at a mirror and try to get information on it, you are teleported back to the enterance of the mansion. I tried this with ever mirror I encountered, and it worked on all but one mirror. I'm not sure if this was an error or if there is something special about that one particular mirror. If not, then further testing should be done in order to keep that function in all mirrors, making it a more uniformed function while also making all mirrors equal.
