#### Review of Luigi's Mansion and aspects that need testing

## Review

Luigi's Mansion is an action adventure game that encourages the player to explore the mansion in order to progress. It was directed by Hideki Konno of Nintendo. The Player takes control of Luigi as he explores a haunted mansion in search of his missing brother, Mario. The Player is given a flashlight, a vacuum cleaner, and a Game Boy Horror to progress through the game. The flashlight can be used to stun ghosts, which are the game's enemies. The player can then suck up the stunned ghost with the vacuum cleaner which is called The Poltergust 3000. The Game Boy Horror shows the Player how much treasure they have collected, a map of the mansion, and information on captured ghosts. It also has a radar function to help the Player find Boos, which are type of ghost the player must capture in order to beat the game.

## What Needs Testing

Name 3-5 aspects of the game you think should be tested and why?

Example: 

The tennis game on Wii Sports is a very fun and easy game to play. The maker of Wii sports is Nintendo and there are several other sports that can be played on the Wii Sports game disc. After playing the tennis game on Wii Sports, there are several functions I think a tester would look at.

One function that would be looked at immediately is the player mode/selection. A total of four players can play a tennis match; this can be done with 1 Wii remote or multiple Wii remotes. Another important function that might be tested is the player movement, making sure the direction you are moving is in line with the game.  Scoring would be another major function that should be tested, if a player hits the ball out of bound or hits the net, making sure a proper out occurs and the scoring is incremented correctly.

These are just a few of the initial functions that would a tester would need to look at when evaluating the Wii Sports tennis game.
